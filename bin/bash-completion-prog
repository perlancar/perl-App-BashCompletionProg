# ABSTRACT: Manage bash completion commands/scripts
# PODNAME: bash-completion-f

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 Installation

To install system-wide:

 % touch /etc/bash-completion-f

and put C<. /etc/bash-completion-f> in C</etc/bash.bashrc> or C</etc/profile>.

To install for a single user:

 % touch ~/.bash-completion-f

and put C<. ~/.bash-completion-f> in ~/.bashrc or C<~/.bash_profile>.

=head2 Usage

To add a completion command:

 % bash-completion-f add --id bar 'complete -C foo bar'

which will add a line like this in C</etc/bash-completion-f> (if you are running
as root) or C<~/.bash-completion-f> (if running as normal user):

 complete -C foo bar # FRAGMENT id=bar

Later you can remove this line programmatically with:

 % bash-completion-f remove --id bar

You can also add a multiline command, e.g.:

 % bash-completion-f add --id qux '
 _qux() {
   ...
 }
 complete -F _qux qux'

which will add these lines to the file:

 # BEGIN FRAGMENT id=qux
 _qux() {
   ...
 }
 complete -F _qux qux
 # END FRAGMENT id=qux

For more subcommands and options, see documentation or C<bash-completion-f
--help>.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script can be used to manage a collection of completion scripts. It is
somewhat similar to the B<bash-completion> package, except for a few differences
described below:

Firstly, the goal of the C<bash-completion> project is to collect completion
routines for most Unix/Linux command-line utilities, while the goal of
C<bash-completion-f> is to make it easier to add/remove a collection of
C<complete> bash commands.

Secondly, due to its goal, if you install and use C<bash-completion> you will
notice a significant overhead/delay everytime you start a new shell, because
bash has to parse thousands of lines of completion definition, even though I
won't be using most of the completions. I currently disable bash-completion
exactly for this reason. There is currently an effort to do dynamic loading of
completions: if that feature arrives, then I will probably use the package
again.

C<bash-completion-f> arose from my need to ease installing (and uninstalling)
bash completion routines. I write lots of command-line utilities packaged as
Perl distributions. Written using the L<Perinci::CmdLine> framework, these
utilities have bash completion capability, activated using C<complete -C
command-name command-name> (the scripts are handling their own completion).
Using this script, instead of putting those C<complete> commands directly on
bash startup file, I can put them in C</etc/bash-completion-f> or
C<~/.bash-completion-f> and manage them using the script.

To keep things simple, by default C<bash-completion-f> stores the C<complete>
commands in a single file instead of a directory (thus the "-f" suffix in the
script's name, which can mean "file" among other things). Each entry is marked
and can be added and removed separately.

A special shortcut is provided for these L<Perinci::CmdLine>-based utilities. If
you say:

 % bash-completion-f add-pc foo bar

it is equivalent to:

 % bash-completion-f add --id foo 'complete -C foo foo'
 % bash-completion-f add --id bar 'complete -C bar bar'

Another convenient is a C<add-all-pc> to scan all Perinci::CmdLine-based scripts
in PATH and add them all:

 % bash-completion-f add-all-pc

Or all scripts in specified directories:

 % bash-completion-f add-all-pc ~/scripts


=head1 COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

These options are common for all subcommands.

=head2 --file, -f

Specify an alternate location for the C<bash-completion-f> file. By default it's
C</etc/bash-completion-f> for root, or C<~/.bash-completion-f> for normal users.


=head1 SUBCOMMANDS

(This section will be generated dynamically in the future).

=head2 add

=head2 add-pc

=head2 add-all-pc

=head2 remove

=head2 remove-all

This subcommand will empty your C<bash-completion-f> file by removing all
entries.

=head2 list

Options: C<--detail>.

=head2 clean


=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 DEBUG => bool

Set to true to enable debugging messages.
